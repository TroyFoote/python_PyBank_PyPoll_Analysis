# Python PyBank & PyPoll
Module 3

## Project Description

## PyBank

You are tasked with creating a Python script to analyse the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

### Instructions

Create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset

2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

3. The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

You are tasked with helping a small, rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process.

### Instructions

Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
